                        &emsp; &emsp; The WHO (World Health Organization) declared COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic on the 11th of March in 2020, because of the speed and scale at which the disease was spreading. Prior to that, it was first reported in Wuhan, a city in China, on February 26. As early studies began, the infectious substance of COVID-19 was discovered to be a novel coronavirus, but as more studies were practiced, the virus was found to be related to the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. According to the WHO, over 8,000 people were infected by this outbreak and over 750 people died.  Therefore, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses named this new virus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), commonly known as COVID-19. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        &emsp; &emsp; The origin of this very dangerous disease is still not fully verified yet, although cases have been connected to a Huanan seafood market where wild animals like bats, birds and snakes are sold. An online article, published by the National Center for Biotechnology, showed a study that was conducted in the early stages of the pandemic which suggested a bat to be the origin of the virus. Another theory of the origin suggested the origin was a Pangolin, but evidence of transmission from human to human became the most supported theory after a visit by the World Health Organization on January 22, 2020. Since the outbreak in February 2020 in just 4 short months there were over eight thousand cases of COVID-19, a number that only continues to exponentially increase as more time passes. As of the beginning of this month (December 2021) their has been over 271 million cases of COVID-19, with over 50 million cases stemming from the US.

                    <p class="lead">
                        &emsp; &emsp; COVID-19 can be transmitted through people by breathing, talking, coughing, or sneezing near or in close contact with diseased patients. After an analysis, done by the CDC, of trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, Italy, and New York City, it was shown that airborne transmission is the dominant way the disease spreads. This analysis revealed that among the many mitigations measures the importance of wearing a mask is very dominant in the formation of the trends we are seeing when talking about the spread of the disease. Even though, 80% of individuals are asymptomatic, due to good immune response, there is still sufficient evidence that these individuals can indeed infect others with the disease. The most efficient way to avoid the spread of the virus is by taking various precautions given by the CDC. These precautions include washing your hands frequently, practicing social distances with others, covering your nose and mouth with a mask and cleaning/disinfecting surfaces touched frequently.

                        &emsp; &emsp; Wearing masks is extremely important to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. As stated earlier, the virus spreads from one person to another who are in close contact with one another, by the transmission of little balls of saliva and moisture when a COVID-19 patient either talks, sneezes or coughs.

                        &emsp; &emsp; It is very important to quarantine if you have been within six feet of someone with COVID-19 unless you have been fully vaccinated. If you are fully vaccinated, you do not need to quarantine unless they were experiencing the symptoms described above. It is still a good idea for vaccinated people to get tested anywhere between five to seven days after exposure, even if they experience no symptoms and they should also wear a mask while indoors for the following 14 days after the exposure or until they receive a negative test result. After your quarantine is completed, it is still important to watch your symptoms until 14 days after exposure, if you do happen to feel symptoms it is important to immediately self-isolate and to make sure you contact your local health provider.

                        &emsp; &emsp; Isolation is also very important to keeping the spread of the disease very low. Isolation is used to divide those who are infected and those who are not. If you are in isolation you should stay at home until it is safe, at home everyone that has COVID-19 should be separated. While in isolation it is important to monitor your symptoms, also try to use separate bathrooms with those who have the virus, if possible. You should make sure to avoid contact with all other members of the house, including pets and weak a mask when or if you need to be around others. Isolation should be fourteen days long, it is very important to isolate for all fourteen days because even though you may not be experiencing any symptoms, you could still transmit the disease.

The three vaccines include, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. Although all three of the vaccinations are safe and effective in reducing the risk of getting the disease each vaccine is different and it’s important to understand these differences when choosing which vaccine to get.

                        &emsp; &emsp; The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is an mRNA vaccine that requires two separate shots 21 days apart, both are injected in the upper part of your arm. This vaccine is recommended for people ages five or older. There is also a new booster shot recommended for those who meet the age requirement, 18 years or older and are at a higher risk of COVID-19. This booster is recommended to be applied six months after you get the first two doses. Nearly all the ingredients found in the vaccine can be found in many foods like fat, salts, and sugars and a harmless piece of mRNA. This mRNA teaches your body to synthetize the immune response which allows it to defend against the virus in the future. Once the immunity is created your body discards all other ingredients in the vaccine, the same way your body discards any substance that it doesn’t need anymore. It is important to note that there are two slightly different Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, one for ages twelve and older and one for ages five – eleven.

For ages 5-15, the trials concluded that the vaccine had a greater that 90% efficacy in preventing the disease. The CDC is working very closely with the FDA to ensure that more updates will be provided as more research is being made on the vaccine.

Just like the previous vaccine, this one is also given on the upper arm and is approved for those who are 18 years or older. Once again, there is also a recommended booster shot that should be taken six months after the second dosage. All ingredients in this vaccine can be commonly found in many foods and includes a mRNA that teaches the cells to be immune.

                        &emsp; &emsp; In clinical trials, there were signs of side effects within seven days of receiving the vaccine. According to the CDC, after the second dose there was a significant increase of side effects throughout the rest of your body. Also, based on these medical studies, this vaccine was effective against 94% of the time against COVID-19. It is important to note that this is only effective if you have received both parts of the vaccine. Another significant discovery in the trials was an increased effectiveness against COVID-19 among people with diverse age, race, sex, and ethnic groups.

                        &emsp; &emsp; The Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine is also given on the upper arm muscle, but it is not an mRNA vaccine, it is a viral vector. According to the CDC, this vaccine uses “a modified version of a virus that is different from the virus being targeted to deliver important instructions to our cells. The modified version of the virus is called a vector virus.” Also, according to the CDC, as the vector enters the body, it creates a benign spike protein. Your immune system then recognizes this protein as an intruder and triggers the production of antibodies and activates cells to fight off this protein. This is how our bodies learn to defend our bodies from any viruses in the future, like COVID-19. It is of importance to note that the J&J vaccine only requires one dose and is approved to be administered to those who are 18 years or older.

                        &emsp; &emsp; In clinical trials, side effects can occur within one or two days after getting administered the vaccine. These are not necessarily bad, as these can be signs that the vaccine is doing its job teaching your body to protect it against future viruses. These symptoms should no longer be visible after a few days. In the medical trials the J&J vaccine was proven to be effective 66.3% of the time against COVID-19. One important thing to note for this vaccine is that this vaccine did have a significantly higher rate at preventing hospitalization or death.

                        &emsp; &emsp; There are many misconceptions about vaccines in general and more specifically about COVID-19 vaccines. Below I will debunk a few of the many myths: 
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead" style="margin-left: 10%;">
                        a) No, new variants are created by natural changes through a natural mutation. COVID-19 vaccines help prevent new variants from emerging, a high vaccination population helps reduce the spread of the virus and prevents the emergence of new variants
                    </p>

                        &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; 2) Can receiving a COVID-19 vaccine make you magnetic?
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead" style="margin-left: 10%;">
                        a) No, COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any ingredients that can create an electromagnetic field. Every available COVID-19 vaccine is free of any metals. Once your body learns to be immune it will get rid of all unused materials into waste.

                    <p class="lead" style="margin-left: 10%;">
                        a) No, COVID-19 does not change or interact with your DNA. Both mRNA and viral vector vaccines deliver their instructions to the cells to begin building the protection against the virus. The material never actually enters the nucleus, which is where our DNA is kept.

                    <p class="lead">
                        &emsp; &emsp; Politics has played a very critical role in many aspects relating to the vaccine. One of the biggest roles is the role the political divide plays on whether someone has gotten vaccinated. In today’s politics, there is a strong division amongst the two political parties. Especially between those who are pro-Trump and those who are pro-Biden. If you take a look at Figure 8 you can clearly see that those who voted in favor of Biden had a higher vaccination rate that those who voted for Trump.

                        &emsp; &emsp; Another important impact of politics on vaccination is whether getting vaccinated should be mandated. Once again, the two sides to this argument have split at political lines, those who are in favor of Biden are in favor of mandating vaccinations while those who are in favor of Trump are on the opposing side. As President Joe Biden stated, "We have the tools to combat COVID-19, and a distinct minority of Americans, supported by a distinct minority of elected officials, are keeping us from turning the corner” as he was referring to those who oppose the mandates. The truth to the reality is, if these mandates were put in place, this would result in an increase of people getting vaccinated. According to republican pollster Frank Luntz, “It was plain to see they were mad about [the new rules], but a significant percentage of those who are not vaccinated would actually accept it if it meant that they could travel, if it meant that they could continue to work in the office," he said. "And what's left? Those people who refuse to do it — nothing is going to change their mind.” If vaccination mandates were put in place, those who are skeptical of the vaccine would feel much more inclined to receiving it, as it would allow them to travel, eat at restaurants and just do normal pre-pandemic activities.

                        &emsp; &emsp; In conclusion, COVID-19 has been very detrimental to everyone, it was so impactful that it was able to stop some of the most powerful economies in the world. It is important for all of us to do our part to end this pandemic. One of the easiest ways of doing this is by getting vaccinated. As shown in this article, vaccinees are very reliable in protecting you and other against the vaccine and are safe for use. These vaccines do not contain any microchips, metals or any other harmful ingredients that could cause any harm. Also, as explained in the article, there has been numerous clinical trials on these vaccines and based on the results these vaccines are very effective in preventing the vaccine and are not causing any major harm to anyone. We must unite as a country and get vaccinated in order to move on and get this country back to where it was prior to March 11th 2020. Getting vaccinated is a very feasible and quick thing to do, but it yields great impact when it comes to overcoming this pandemic. We should not focus on being republican or democrat, black or white, or even male or female. We must remember we are all humans, and together we must all do our part to overcome this pandemic and getting vaccinated is an essential part to that.
